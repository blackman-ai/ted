# Ted Security Assessment Report

## Overview
- **Project**: Ted AI Coding Assistant
- **Version**: 0.1.0
- **Date**: January 2024
- **Assessment Severity**: 🟨 Low-Medium Risk

## Security Strengths

### Language and Framework
- Modern Rust implementation with strong type safety
- Async runtime (`tokio`) for secure concurrency
- Comprehensive error handling with `thiserror` and `anyhow`

### Dependency Management
- Up-to-date dependencies
- Secure serialization with `serde`
- Secure HTTP client with `reqwest`
- Robust logging with `tracing`

### Parsing and Input Handling
- Secure CLI argument parsing with `clap`
- Structured approach to command processing

## Potential Security Concerns

### Dependency Vulnerabilities
1. **Unmaintained Dependencies**
   - `instant` (used by `notify`)
   - `paste` (used by `ratatui`)
   
   **Recommendation**: 
   - Update to latest maintained versions
   - Consider alternative libraries if updates are not available

### Execution and Command Handling
- Potential risks in shell/command execution mechanisms
- Requires careful implementation to prevent command injection

### LLM Integration Security
- Need robust input sanitization for LLM prompts
- Validate and sanitize system and user messages
- Implement strict input validation

### File System Operations
- Uses `walkdir` and `glob` for file operations
- Potential path traversal vulnerabilities
- Requires comprehensive path sanitization

## Specific Recommendations

1. **Dependency Management**
   - Regularly update dependencies
   - Use `cargo audit` in CI/CD pipeline
   - Monitor RustSec advisories

2. **Input Validation**
   - Implement strict input validation for all user inputs
   - Use type-safe parsing
   - Sanitize file paths and command inputs
   - Implement allowlist for permitted operations

3. **Sensitive Data Handling**
   - Use `secrecy` crate for handling sensitive information
   - Implement memory zeroing with `zeroize`
   - Avoid logging sensitive data

4. **API and External Interactions**
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Use secure, environment-based configuration
   - Add CSRF protection for web interactions
   - Validate and sanitize all external inputs

5. **Error Handling**
   - Ensure errors do not expose sensitive system information
   - Implement generic error messages for production
   - Log detailed errors securely

## Security Scanning Recommendations

- Integrate `cargo-audit` in CI/CD
- Use `clippy` for additional static analysis
- Implement fuzz testing
- Regular dependency vulnerability scans

## Conclusion
The Ted AI Coding Assistant shows a solid foundation in security practices. By implementing the recommended improvements, the project can further enhance its security posture.

### Severity Breakdown
- **Critical Vulnerabilities**: 0
- **High Risk Issues**: 0
- **Medium Risk Issues**: 2-3
- **Low Risk Issues**: Multiple

**Next Steps**:
1. Review and implement recommendations
2. Conduct thorough security review
3. Implement continuous security monitoring
