# Code of Conduct

## The Short Version

Don't be a dick.

## The Longer Version

We're all here to build something cool. To keep this a good place to work:

**Be respectful.** Disagree with ideas, not people. Keep feedback constructive.

**Be helpful.** We were all beginners once. Answer questions kindly.

**Be professional.** No harassment, no personal attacks, no trolling. You know what's inappropriate.

**Take responsibility.** Made a mistake? Own it, fix it, move on.

## Enforcement

If someone's being a problem, report it to the maintainers. We'll handle it.

Consequences range from a warning to a permanent ban, depending on severity.

## That's It

Be decent to each other. We're building software, not drama.
